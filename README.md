# OpenOverlayTA
The purpose of this repository is to have a simple open source overlay template for tournament assistant by [MatrikMoon]( https://github.com/MatrikMoon/TournamentAssistant ). The goal is to make developing your own overlay more accessible. This is achieved by having simple functions and showing one or more examples on how it could be implemented. Simple integrations with [BeatKhana!](https://beatkhana.com/) and [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) will also be included. It is possible that more will get added. This however is not a guarantee and depends solely on the time and dedication of the developer(s).

## BSE
The directory of BSE and deeper is by far not my proudest work. Its a combination of bandaid fixes over multiple years. It is also likely the only React based repo that I will be putting on here. Please look at it with caution and don't trust that my decisions were made with much thought.
