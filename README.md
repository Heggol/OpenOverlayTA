# OpenOverlayTA
The purpose of this repository is to have a simple open source overlay template for tournament assistant by [MatrikMoon]( https://github.com/MatrikMoon/TournamentAssistant ). The goal is to make developing your own overlay more accessible. This is achieved by having simple functions and showing one or more examples on how it could be implemented. Simple integrations with [BeatKhana!](https://beatkhana.com/), [Twitch](https://dev.twitch.tv/) and [BeatSaver](https://beatsaver.com/) will also be included. It is possible that more will get added. This however is not a guarantee and depends solely on the time and dedication of the developer(s).
